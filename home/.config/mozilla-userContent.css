/* 
 * UPDATE 2018-10-08: I've found a workaround for this that doesn't involve custom CSS, so this is disabled for now.
 * I've left this here in case the workaround stops working.
 *
 * For reference the workaround is: https://www.mkammerer.de/blog/gtk-dark-theme-and-firefox/
 * The Mozilla bug, outstanding for 18 years now, is: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70315
 *
 * This is intended to be copied onto the profile directory for your profile in Firefox.
 * This can't be automated because sadly Firefox generates this at random at each install.
 * It's probably something like ~/.mozilla/firefox/[blah.blah].  You can `cat ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini` 
 * to see which profile is default.
 *
 * This file should go into the `chrome/` subdirectory and be renamed to `userContent.css`.  
 *
 * You'll be tempted to symlink this file to the one tracked by git but that would be too easy.  For some
 * reason as of this writing (Firefox version 58) if `userContent.css` is a symlink it's not loaded.  So be
 * very careful when editing this file to make sure you edit the authoritative copy in ~/.config/mozilla-userContent.css 
 * and copy it manually into your profile.
 *
 * The purpose of this file is to fix the color of text elements when using a dark GTK them, like Akto or Arc Dark.
 *
 * If you use a light theme, don't bother.
