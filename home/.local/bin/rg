# Ugly hack to allow running `rg` within a tmux popup window.
#
# For reasons I don't understand, tmux popup windows aren't like regular tmux
# panes, they don't have any of the environment variables of the parent, and
# none of the shell startup scripts like .zshrc or .profile are evaluated.  As
# a result, `rg` is not in the path because we use `cargo install rg` and that
# puts it in `~/.cargo/bin`, but in this tmux popup hellscape the only suitable
# user-specific path is $HOME/.local/bin.  I don't know what sets that as part
# of the path, it's definitely not /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc.
#
# In any case, as an act of desperation I'm making this shim script which will be in the path
# and will forward to the actual cargo-compiled binary binary

if [[ -x "$HOME/.cargo/bin/rg" ]]; then
	"$HOME/.cargo/bin/rg" "$@"
else
	cargo install ripgrep && "$HOME/.cargo/bin/rg" "$@"
